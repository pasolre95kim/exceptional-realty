        <h4>3. How far in advance do you plan a wedding? </h4>
        <div className='description'>
          <p>We recommend waiting about three weeks before jumping into wedding planning.</p>
          <p> This gives you time to revel in your engagement, but not too long so you don't lose momentum. </p>
          <p> Once you're ready to start planning, take it step by stepâ€”</p>
          <p> it's not a good idea to try to plan your whole wedding at once</p>

        <div className='header'>Question 4</div>
          <h4>What is the groom's family supposed to pay for? </h4>

          <p>the marriage license, officiant's fee, corsages, boutonnieres, the bride's bouquet,  </p>
          <p>groomsmen gifts, liquor, and the reception DJ, band or other musical entertainment.</p>
          <p>And the bride's parents pay for everything else.</p>
